# ToDo-List
In this HTML code creates a simple to-do list web page with the title "To-Do List." Inside the page, there's a main container that holds everything. At the top, there's a heading that says "To-Do List" with an image next to it. Below the heading, there is a text box where you can type in a task you want to add, and a button labeled "Add Task" to add it to your list. When you click the "Add Task" button, a JavaScript function (defined in the `app.js` file) will add the task to the list below. The list of tasks will appear in an area marked by an unordered list (`ul`) with the ID `list-container`. The look and feel of the page are controlled by a CSS file called `style.css`. This setup allows you to enter and add tasks to a list that you can see on the page.
